# Tik-Tac-Toe
This is a project I did with Bruin IEEE. The circuit was built with the instructions given [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12zJmVFkFU5TZozYEekRMlBaQ7-u6MgCJe5gAbSow4Fg/edit?usp=sharing). Note that the code needs the tik-tac-toe library (included in this repository) to function.

This is a picture of the game device.

You can use the joy stick to place O's and X's onto the game board.

[This video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xu_RuYDYeFWfi9AHcD9hCLMo0Cxis_JX/view?usp=sharing) shows a demonstration of how the device works.
