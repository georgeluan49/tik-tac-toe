# Tik-Tac-Toe
This is a project I did with Bruin IEEE. The circuit was built with the instructions given [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12zJmVFkFU5TZozYEekRMlBaQ7-u6MgCJe5gAbSow4Fg/edit?usp=sharing). Note that the code needs the tik-tac-toe library (included in this repository) to function.
